# Intro to Regression

## Learning objectives

Introduce linear regression

- how do we find the line of best fit?
- what is the slope
- what is the intercept
- what is r squared

Using R to run a linear regression and add a regression line to a scatter plot

How do we transform data that do not look linear to make a line?

How do outliers influence our line of best fit?

Important cautions:

- association is *not* causation
- do not extrapolate beyond your data
- always consider potential confounders in your interpretation
- confirm the shape of your data visually
