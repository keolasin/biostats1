# PPDAC

The approach we'll use in this course to answer questions with statistics

1. **Problem**
2. **Plan**
3. **Data Analysis**
4. **Conclusion**

## Problem

A clear statement of what we are trying to achieve

### Three main problem types

1. Descriptive - learning about some particular attribute of a population. 
   - how many cases of influenza have we seen this season compared to last season?
2. Causative/Etiologic - do changes in an explanatory variable cause changes in a response variable?
   - if we treat patients with diabetes using medication x, will their insulin regulation be better or worse than medication y
3. Predictive - how can we best predict the value of the response variable for an individual?
   - insurance company, what is the probability that a 25 year old unmarried male driver has a car accident?

## Plan (03:50)

The procedures we use to carry out the study.

- Census or sample from the target population?
  - how was the sampling conducted?
  - was the sample random?
- is the study prospective or retrospective?
- is the study observational or experimental?

## Data (05:40)

The data which is collected according to the **plan**

- how many observations do we have?
- how reliable are the measures?

## Analysis (06:00)

The data is summarized and analysed to answer the questions posed by the **problem**.

We use our knowledge about probabilities to assess the role of chance in our findings.

## Conclusion (07:11)

Conclusions are drawn about what has been learned about answering the **problem**

## PPDAC example: Smoking behavior (07:30)

**Problem**: suppose we wish to study the smoking behavior of CA residents aged 14-20. Interested in prevalence of current smoking by gender in particular. (Descriptive problem)
**Plan**: we need to first choose a time period, because we know that smoking behavior changes over time. unfeasible to do it for everyone 14-20 years old in CA, so we need a random sample. We collect:

- random sample of size n persons
- age, gender, smoking status of those persons

Need to decide how large *n* should be, and how to obtain the random sample, especially if it's to be representative of the population of interest.

**Data**: Suppose that a random sample of 200 persons aged 14-20 was selected, yielding data:

|                    | number of smokers | number of non-smokers | total |
|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| teen girls & women | 32                | 66                    | 98    |
| teen boys & men    | 27                | 75                    | 102   |
| total              | 59                | 141                   | 200   |

**Analysis**: Proportion of women in the sample who smoke is 32/98 = 33%
The proportion of men in the sample who smoke is 27/102 = 26%

**Conclusion**: 33% of girls & women aged 14-20 and 26% of boys and men of the same age group are current smokers in California in 2018 (plus a measure of uncertainty).
