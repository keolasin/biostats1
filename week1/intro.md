# Lecture 1: Introduction to Datahub and PPDAC

## What is this class?

going to think about:

1. Data - how we gather, display, and summarize info
2. Probability - the role of chance
3. Statistics - the science of drawing statistical conclusions from data using a knowledge of probability

## Three parts of the course

1. Learning to explore and summarize univariate and bivariate distributions
2. Classical problems in probability and some commonly used probability distributions and the central limit theorem
3. Statistical inference, the process of estimating stats from samples to make inference about pops

## Goals for the semester

- Want to develop critical thinking around statistical information (in both scientific and non-scientific forums)
- Want to develop sense of how you approach answering your own questions in data
- Become a good communicator of information and sense of how we answer questions effectively with data

## This is *not* a math class

Stats is often classified as a branch of math, but it's more important to focus on the **connections that stats has with science**

- Not much math actually needed to learn intro stats
- This class will try to emphasize concepts and help you develop your statistical intuition

### Also not a programming class

Sometimes stats is viewed as computer programming - rather, computer programming is simply a tool for conducting stastical analysis.

The use of computer programming in statistics is and should be quite different than approaches to non-statistical programming

This course uses R programming

- useful skill
- facilitates computation
- desirable in the job market

## Relevancy

Stats is truly relevant to everyone. Public health stats has relevance to important policy decisions (Covid-19?). Daily decisions influenced by stats as well, and stats is relevant for many other professions.

Stats is useful for understanding the news and the world around us!

### Example: Coffee and cancer risk

California prop 65 mandates labeling for products with risks, such as acrylamide produced from coffee roasting, so Starbucks has to show a sign stating the association between coffee and cancer.

- the data mentioned relies on stats:
  - importance of data source (sampling and target populations)
  - mechanism for exposure assignment (random vs non-random)
  - importance of how much data are available (sample size)
  - quality of the data (measurement error)
  - concept of statistical association vs causal association
  - difference between statistical significance and clinical significance

Later, in 2019, evidence shows that the risk of cancer is low enough from coffee that the labeling can be removed

#### Public perception of science?

As public health practitioners, we are concerned with what happens to the public perception of science when these kinds of warnings are issued.
We should aim to be better at communicating our findings to inform policy and public opinion.
